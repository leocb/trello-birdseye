# Trello Business Style

> Chrome Extension for proper board/card styling when you have too much information on your cards on Trello

**Why?**
Trello is great, but if you have a lot of information on your cards, the interface becomes a mess. information is scattered everywhere! Wouldn't you sometimes wish you could just keep it all organized?

**How?**
This small Chrome Extension adds an extra button to the Trello toolbar. Click it and you get *Text on one side, card info on the other*.

## Install

[**Add the extension to Chrome** from the webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/trello-business-style/knkibcjejmdcepoomodabefjobmajoco)

That's it. Look for the "Business Style" button in the boards toolbar in Trello :+1:
